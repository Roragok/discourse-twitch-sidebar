# Twitch_Sidebar

This plugin creates a widget that allows users to enter a comma sperated list of twitch users to be displayed in an active livestream block.
It iterates through the list of users and displays them in a widget called 'twitch'.


## Plugin Settings

It creates two plugin settings
- Block Title - text field for the block title
- Twitch Users - commas delimited set of twitch users to display

## Setup
This plugin is dependent on the [layouts plugin](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp)
Once both are installed, you simply need to add the widget 'twitch' to either the left or right sidebar.
Then enter the list of twitch users to the user field.
